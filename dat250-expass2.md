## Technical problems
I didn't encounter any specific technical difficulties, but thought the whole process of installing everything and getting it to work properly was challenging. Therefore i used quite a bit of time to understand the connection of these tools and installing them properly.

## how i inspected the database
I used some simple queries as "show tables" to show me all the tables (as seen in the pictures above), as well as "select * from "insert table here"" to show me the contents of each table.
