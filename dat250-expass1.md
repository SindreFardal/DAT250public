Software Technology Experiment 1

Technical problems:
I encountered some problems with the setup of maven, which got resolved quite quickly.
I did not encounter any other technical or other types of problems while installing the software development environment.

validation:
I checked that the environment was working by running it with different variables both locally and online, and compared it to the tutorial.
