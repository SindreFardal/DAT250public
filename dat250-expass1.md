# Software Technology Experiment 1

## Technical problems
I encountered some problems with the setup of maven which i tried to install via VSC, but eventually got it to work by restarting and editing some files.
I did not encounter any other technical or other types of problems while installing the software development environment.

## validation
I checked that the environment was working by running it with different variables both locally and online, and compared it to the tutorial.
