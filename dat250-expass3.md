## Technical problems
I didn't encounter many problems/difficulties but one i did encounter was when trying to install MongoDB was "Failed to add user to group. <some numbers> SINDRE-PC Performance Monitor Users". I solved this by typing "net localgroup "Performance Monitor Users" /add" into cmd, and i was good to go.
